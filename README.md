### Overview 
For this project, Python and SQLAlchemy were used to gather statistics on weather data for the months of June and December in Hawaii from the given dataset in a sqlite file. The end goal is to determine wheter or not a surf shop would be a sucessful business idea throughtout the year depending on the history of weather. The jupyter notebook file SurfsUp_Challenge is where this code resides.

### Results 
After filtering the dataset to only include the months of June and December, the describe() function was used to produce the following dataframes for each month's recorded temperatures:

From the two dataframes, it can be seen that 
- the mean temperature in both months is in the low seventies with a standard deviation of about three degrees. So the temperature appears to be consistent enough at the halfways points in the year so that a surf shop can stay in business all year instead of only seasonal.  
- However, the minimum temperature in June is higher than the minumum in December, approximating nearly eight degrees colder in Decemeber than in June. The difference is not necessarily too drastic that the surf shop would not survive around this time, but just points to the fact that perhaps there would be fewer days of operation for the shop around the Decemeber months, or that there would just be fewer customers on those days who are willing to bear the colder temperatures out on the water.
-Fifty percent of the recorded temperatures fall between 73ยบ and 77ยบ in June, and 69ยบ and 74ยบ in Decemeber, a range that seems managable for a surf shop
